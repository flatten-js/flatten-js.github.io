    <h2>Flat</h2>
    Nice to meet you!
    I'm 18 years old of Pichi Pichi who has been stripped of the high school brand.

    When I was in high school,
    I worked part-time (including volunteers) as a fledgling engineer for multiple companies.
    I was mainly in charge of the front end and was involved in
    building SPA sites using React and developing web applications using Vue (etc).

    After that, I entered a period of full-fledged job hunting,
    decided which company I would like to go to,
    and received an employment email after the interview.

    But I declined.
    The reason is simple, it's a difference in thinking.

    I don't have a job right now,
    but as an important opportunity for self-development,
    I am studying hard,
    focusing not only on the front end but also on the backside and new technologies.
